    "Housing prices vary due to a confluence of various factors including location, size of the house, size of the lot, to name only a few. The extent to which each factor correlates with house prices is not a cut and dry formula. As such, it can be difficult to predict what price one should sell their house for or what price one should offer for a house. This project is built to help figure out these values and the variables that affect housing prices."
